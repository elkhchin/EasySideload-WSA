# EasySideload-WSA

Exe files are officially removed due to lot of issue( will be back once I manage to fix them)
Also now you can run fixer.bat(one time) if other 3 bat files give you error.

Note 
- Always keep fixer.bat,adb.exe and AdbWinApi.dll in same folder.
- Other 3 bat files can run from any location.
